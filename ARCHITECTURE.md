## Concurrency Model
```
Main Thread (pystray)
  |  System tray icon event loop (Windows message pump)
  |  Spawns engine thread on startup
  |
  +-- Engine Thread (threading.Thread)
        |  mt5.initialize() HERE (binds MT5 to this thread)
        |  asyncio.run(engine.run_forever())
        |
        +-- Task: uvicorn.Server.serve() — FastAPI at :8501
        +-- Task: supabase_sync_loop() — polls Supabase every 30s
        +-- Task: tp_monitor_loop() — 1s when positions/orders exist
        +-- Task: license_heartbeat() — HTTP POST every 15 min
```

MT5 calls are sync but <50ms. Called directly in the async loop (no executor). Safe because asyncio is single-threaded — tasks yield between MT5 calls.

## Core Loop (sync_cycle.py)
```
1. Query Supabase: active/hit signals + pending limits (1 query)
2. Query Supabase: live_prices for offset instruments (1 query, only if needed)
3. Diff against SQLite order_mappings locally
4. For new limits: calculate lot, compute offset+spread, place MT5 order, write SQLite
5. For stale limits: cancel MT5 order, update SQLite
6. For price drift on offset instruments: modify MT5 order price
```

**Re-placement guard (no duplicate entries).** A "new" limit is `supabase_limit_ids -
sqlite_active_limit_ids` (active = pending/filled), but a limit that has *ever filled*
on our broker (`order_mappings.status IN ('filled','closed')`) is also subtracted, so it
is never placed again — even after its position TPs/closes and the SQLite row goes to
`closed`. This stops the dangerous loop where a limit fills on our end while the TM/DB
still shows it `pending` (sub-pip mismatch, or the TM bot was down / signal went stale):
the position TPs, the `closed` row drops out of `get_all_active()`, and the still-pending
DB limit would otherwise reappear as "new" and re-enter the same level forever. The
`closed` row is the durable, restart-safe marker. Never-filled `cancelled` /
`spread_cancelled` rows are deliberately *excluded* from the guard so legitimate
re-placement (spread hour, news, offset drift, SL change) still works.

## TP Engine (tp/)
```
TPStrategy (Protocol)
  +-- DefaultTPStrategy
        should_trigger() — newest pos >= threshold AND others_pnl >= 0
        execute()        — close earlier positions, partial-close newest, trail remainder
        update_trailing() — ratchet SL (up for longs, down for shorts)

TrailingStopManager
  Called every 1s for is_trailing=1 positions
  SL = bid - trail_distance (longs) or ask + trail_distance (shorts)
  SL only moves in favorable direction, never retreats

TPEngine (engine.py)
  Groups positions by signal_id (via SQLite)
  Delegates to strategy per signal group
```

### TP Trigger Conditions (both must be true simultaneously)
1. Most-recently-filled position (highest ticket#) moved >= `profit_threshold`
2. Combined P&L of ALL OTHER positions for same signal >= 0

### On Trigger
- Earlier positions: close 100% at market
- Newest position: close `partial_close_percent`% at market
- Remainder: enter trailing phase (`is_trailing=1` in SQLite)
- If partial_close_percent=100: close everything, no trail
- If partial_close_percent=0: trail full position, close nothing

### Partial Close Ticket Handling
ICMarkets hedging mode: partial close creates a **new ticket** for the remainder. Original ticket is closed. Fill detector must:
1. Detect new ticket via MT5 deal history
2. Create new SQLite row inheriting signal_id, signal_type, is_trailing from parent

### Asset Class Detection Order (symbol_mapper.py)
1. Metals: `XAUUSD`, `XAGUSD`, `GOLD`, `SILVER`
2. Oil: contains `OIL`, `WTI`, `BRENT`
3. **Stocks**: ends in `.NAS` or `.NYSE` (MUST check before indices)
4. Indices: contains `SPX`, `NAS`, `DAX`, `JP225`, `UK100`, `US500`, `USTEC`, etc.
5. Crypto: ends in `USD`/`USDT` and `len > 6`
6. Forex (default); `JPY` in name -> `forex_jpy`

### TP Defaults
```
Standard:                              Scalp (roughly halved):
  forex:     7 pip / 3 pip trail         forex:     5 pip / 2 pip trail
  forex_jpy: 7 pip / 3 pip trail         forex_jpy: 5 pip / 3 pip trail
  metals:    $4 / $2 trail               metals:    $2 / $1 trail
  indices:   $20 / $5 trail              indices:   $10 / $3 trail
  stocks:    $1 / $0.50 trail            stocks:    $0.50 / $0.25 trail
  crypto:    $300 / $50 trail            crypto:    $150 / $25 trail
  oil:       $0.50 / $0.20 trail         oil:       $0.25 / $0.10 trail
```

### TP Outcomes (Supabase `tp_outcomes` — write-only analytics)
Append-only log for forward-test / backtest analysis. The unit of analysis is the **signal**
(a set of limits sharing one stop loss). Each trade produces **two rows**, distinguished by `stage`:
- `stage='trigger'` — written by `TPEngine` the moment TP fires. `realized_pnl`/`r_multiple` cover
  only the closed portion at that instant (a trailing remainder is still open).
- `stage='final'` — written by `TPFinalizer.sweep` once the signal's last position goes flat.
  Carries the **whole-trade** result. Idempotent via the local SQLite `signal_finalized` guard
  (exactly one final row per signal). For analysis, the `final` row is the source of truth for
  outcome; the `trigger` row shows what was captured at the trigger instant.

`r_multiple` is money-based: `realized_pnl / risk_money`, where
`risk_money = |avg_entry − stop_loss| × (tick_value / tick_size) × total_volume`
(`price_distance_to_money`, `bot/trading/lot_calculator.py`). Shared SL makes this exact for
multi-limit signals. MFE/MAE are price-distance excursions from entry (always ≥ 0), sampled each
TP cycle and aggregated as `MAX` across the signal's tickets.

Column reference (key columns; remainder are self-explanatory):

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `stage` | `'trigger'` or `'final'` — see above |
| `signal_type`, `asset_class`, `symbol`, `direction` | trade classification (`direction`: long/short) |
| `total_limits` / `limits_filled` / `limits_pending` / `limits_cancelled` | level counts; on the trigger row, `limits_filled` ≈ how many levels filled before the bounce |
| `level_sequence` | `sequence_number` of the deepest filled limit — how deep price went before reacting |
| `total_levels` | total limits on the signal |
| `avg_entry_price`, `stop_loss` | volume-weighted entry; shared signal SL |
| `risk_per_limit` | price distance `|avg_entry − stop_loss|` (risk in price units) |
| `risk_percent_cfg` | configured risk % at the time (context for sizing) |
| `r_multiple` | realized reward-to-risk in money terms (the headline metric on the `final` row) |
| `realized_pnl` | account-currency P&L (closed portion on `trigger`; full trade on `final`) |
| `others_pnl` | P&L of non-newest positions at trigger (`trigger` only) |
| `mfe_price` / `mae_price` | max favorable / adverse excursion from entry, price units |
| `mfe_r` / `mae_r` | the same expressed in R (`/ risk_per_limit`). `mfe_r` ≈ ceiling of capturable R; capture-efficiency ≈ realized R ÷ `mfe_r` |
| `tp_trigger_price`, `move_at_trigger` | price and favorable move when TP fired (`trigger` only) |
| `threshold_value`, `threshold_unit` | the TP threshold that fired (`pips`/`dollars`) |
| `partial_close_pct`, `trailing_started` | close/trail behavior at trigger |
| `seconds_to_trigger` | fill → trigger latency (`trigger` only) — impulse speed |
| `hold_seconds` | first fill → final close duration (`final` only) |
| `exit_reason` | `final` only: `trailing_stop` / `tp_full` / `stop_loss` (heuristic from row state — not a precise close-cause audit) |
| `total_volume`, `partial_close_pct`, `bot_version`, `tp_strategy`, `notes` | execution context |
| `mt5_account`, `channel_id`, `written_at` | account, source channel, insert time |
| `symbol_normalized` | DB symbol with broker suffixes stripped (`XAUUSDm`/`USDCAD.pro` → `XAUUSD`/`USDCAD`) — group analysis on this, not `symbol` |
| `account_equity` / `account_balance` | MT5 account state at write time (weight users, spot glitched accounts) |
| `entry_slippage_points` | `final` only: avg (actual fill − intended limit price) in broker points, adverse-positive by direction; NULL when fill prices weren't captured |
| `exit_slippage_points` | avg close slippage in broker points, adverse-positive, bot-initiated closes only. **NULL means broker-side SL/trailing exit (unmeasurable), not zero** |

`notes` on **final** rows is a config snapshot: `{profit_threshold, threshold_unit,
trailing_distance, partial_close_percent, lot: {mode, value, source}, disable_auto_tp,
skip_limits_at}` — so trailing-vs-fixed comparisons aren't confounded by per-user settings.
Trigger rows keep `notes = {"non_trailing_count": N}`.

**Trigger-row dedupe**: the SQLite guard table `trigger_recorded` (PK `(signal_id,
mt5_account, level_sequence)`) is claimed before every trigger-row write. A failed close
re-qualifies the TP every ~1s cycle and used to spam identical trigger rows; now each fill
depth writes exactly once. Cleared by `clear_history` alongside the other guards. Close
retry behaviour is unchanged — only the duplicate INSERT is suppressed.

Adding columns requires an owner-run `ALTER TABLE tp_outcomes ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ...` in the
Supabase SQL editor — the bot only INSERTs. The local SQLite side (`order_mappings.sequence_number`
/ `mfe_price` / `mae_price` / `fill_price` / `exit_slippage_points`, `signal_finalized` and
`trigger_recorded` tables) auto-migrates on startup.

## Spread Adjustment (order_placer.py)
On every pending order placement, adjust price and SL for current spread:
```
spread = ask - bid  (from MT5 live tick)

Long (buy) limits:   adjusted_price = limit_price + spread
                     adjusted_sl    = stop_loss - spread

Short (sell) limits: adjusted_price = limit_price - spread
                     adjusted_sl    = stop_loss + spread
```
Raw DB prices stored in SQLite for reference. Adjusted prices sent to MT5.

## Feed Offset (offset_calculator.py)
For indices/crypto where DB prices come from OANDA/Binance feeds:
```
offset = mt5_mid - feed_mid
mt5_order_price = db_limit_price + offset  (then apply spread adjustment)
```
Offset instruments: SPX500USD->US500, NAS100USD->USTEC, BTCUSDT->BTCUSD, ETHUSDT->ETHUSD.
`mt5_mid` and `feed_mid` are paired AT THE FEED'S EXACT `updated_at`: the broker mid is read
from MT5 tick history (`copy_ticks_range`) matched to `updated_at` to the millisecond
(`time_msc`), so the gap between the feed timestamp and "now" never leaks into the offset
(M1-bar mid is the fallback when tick history is empty). Recompute is throttled per symbol
(`offset_recompute_interval_seconds`, default 300s) and the cached offset served between — one
tick + one history call per symbol per interval; a transient history gap reuses the last good
offset. Dead-feed bound (`feed_max_staleness_seconds`, default 120s): while a signal is active
a stale `updated_at` means the feed updater stalled → skip placement. Readjust existing orders
if offset drift > threshold (default 5 pips).

## Symbol Mapping
| DB Instrument | MT5 Symbol | Offset? |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| XAUUSD / GOLD | XAUUSD | No |
| EURUSD, etc. | same | No |
| SPX500USD | US500 | Yes (OANDA) |
| NAS100USD | USTEC | Yes (OANDA) |
| BTCUSDT | BTCUSD | Yes (Binance) |
| ETHUSDT | ETHUSD | Yes (Binance) |
| AMD.NAS | AMD.NAS-24 | No |
| MSFT.NYSE | MSFT.NYSE-24 | No |

Stock suffix `-24` means 24-hour trading (permanent, not yearly). Configurable in config.json.

## Lot Sizing — Two Modes
**Risk % (default):** `lot = (balance * risk%) / (num_limits * avg_sl_distance_pips * pip_value_per_lot)`
**Fixed lot:** flat lot per limit, ignoring balance/SL/signal size.
Clamped to MT5 symbol volume_min/volume_max, rounded to volume_step.

## Market Hours / Spread Hour (scheduler.py)
Pause placement + cancel pending during:
- Mon-Thu: 3:55 PM - 6:00 PM EST
- Weekend: Fri 3:55 PM - Sun 6:00 PM EST

The window opens at 3:55 PM (an hour before the 5:00 PM spread spike) so late-market
signals stop activating; the earlier 3:55–4:55 slice is a "late-market" phase (pending
cancelled, SLs untouched). Filled-position SL stripping stays pinned to spread hour
proper (4:55–6:00 PM, `sl_strip_start`). Cancelled orders marked `spread_cancelled` in SQLite. Re-placed automatically when markets reopen (sync cycle sees DB limit still pending + no active SQLite mapping).

## News Mode (per-symbol)
`bot_mode_status.news_mode` is a comma-separated list of news tokens (NULL = no news). Tokens are currency codes (`USD`, `EUR`, `JPY`, …) plus named assets (`GOLD`), or the single token `ALL`. A token applies to an instrument when, aliased, it is a substring of the DB symbol — so `USD` gates EURUSD, USDJPY, XAUUSD, SPX500USD; `GOLD` aliases to `XAU` and gates XAUUSD only. Oil is USD-denominated but its symbol (e.g. USOILSPOT) has no `USD` substring, so `USD` news gates it via asset class. `ALL` gates everything. Crypto and 24h stocks are exempt (same as the spread gate). Parsing/matching live in `symbol_mapper.py` (`parse_news_symbols`, `instrument_under_news`).

While a symbol is under news the bot (a) cancels its pending orders (same path as the spread gate) and (b) force-closes any filled positions on that symbol (`SyncCycle._check_news_exits`), mirroring the manual-cancel / breakeven force-exit.

## Volatility Guard (opt-in)
`bot_mode_status.vol_guard` is a second token column written by the signal service's volatility monitor — identical format to `news_mode` (comma-separated currency codes / named assets, or `ALL`, NULL when calm). It is **off by default and only consumed when the user enables `volatility_guard` in Misc settings**. When on, the sync cycle reads `vol_guard` alongside `news_mode` in a single `bot_mode_status` row fetch (`SupabaseDB.fetch_mode_gates`) and unions its tokens into the same gate set, so volatility tokens cancel pending orders and force-close filled positions through the exact same path, parsing, and crypto/24h exemptions as news. When off, the column is read but its tokens are dropped, so the guard has no effect. Reaction time tracks the existing sync cadence (1s while any order/position is live).

## Polling Strategy
| State | MT5 calls/min | Supabase queries/min |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Idle (no signals/orders) | 0 | 2 |
| Pending orders (watching fills) | 120 | 2 |
| Positions open (TP monitoring) | 120 | 2 |
| Trailing | 120 + SL mods | 2 |

Scalp strategy — every second matters. 1s polling when any pending orders or positions exist.

## License System
- Supabase Edge Function (Deno/TypeScript) at `supabase/functions/validate-license/`
- Bot POSTs `{license_key, mt5_account}` to Edge Function URL
- Validates key exists, active, not expired, MT5 account matches
- Startup: validate or refuse to start
- Heartbeat: re-validate every 15 min
- On failure: block new placements, keep managing open positions
- URL: production hardcoded in constants.py, contributors override via `.env`

## Startup Reconciliation (reconciler.py)
1. Get MT5 orders + positions filtered by magic number
2. Compare against SQLite order_mappings
3. Pending in SQLite + in MT5 positions -> mark filled
4. Pending in SQLite + gone from MT5 -> mark cancelled
5. Filled in SQLite + gone from MT5 -> mark closed
6. Filled + is_trailing=1 + still in MT5 -> resume trailing
7. MT5 orders with our magic but not in SQLite -> log warning (orphans), do NOT auto-cancel

## Signal Tracking
Multiple signals can exist for same instrument. signal_id encoded in MT5 order comment: `"s{signal_id}"` (e.g. `"s12345"`). Primary mapping is SQLite `order_mappings.signal_id`. Comment is reconciliation fallback.

## Supabase Schema (Read-Only)
**signals**: id, instrument, direction(long/short), stop_loss, status(active/hit/profit/breakeven/stop_loss/cancelled), type(standard/scalp/swing/toll/pa/1-1), expiry_time, channel_id
**limits**: id, signal_id(FK), price_level, sequence_number, status(pending/hit/cancelled)
**live_prices**: symbol(PK), bid, ask, feed(oanda/binance), updated_at
**licenses**: queried by the Edge Function for validation, and SELECTed by the bot only as a subquery in the `users` UPSERT to resolve `license_id`
**users**: per-license snapshot (balance / equity / cumulative P&L / wins / losses / win_rate). UPSERT-only from the bot, every 5 min. Schema in CLAUDE.md.

## SQLite Schema (orders.db)

Per-type override fallback rules (see `bot/tp/asset_config.py`):

- `standard` — uses the base asset-class config.
- `scalp`, `toll`, `pa` — use the per-asset override if present; otherwise fall back to the base asset-class config.
- `swing` — uses the per-asset override if present; otherwise falls back to `3 × base.profit_threshold`.
- `1-1` — engine forces `threshold_unit='dollars'`, `partial_close_percent=100`, and `trailing_distance=0`. Only `one_to_one.profit_threshold` (and per-asset `overrides`) is user-tunable. Trailing is also gated off explicitly in `TPEngine._process_group`.

## Order Type Selection Logic
The order type depends on signal direction and limit price relative to current market:
```
direction=long:
  limit_price < current_ask  -> BUY_LIMIT  (price below market, expect bounce up)
  limit_price > current_ask  -> BUY_STOP   (price above market, expect breakout up)

direction=short:
  limit_price > current_bid  -> SELL_LIMIT (price above market, expect reversal down)
  limit_price < current_bid  -> SELL_STOP  (price below market, expect breakdown)
```
After spread adjustment is applied to the price, the comparison uses the adjusted price.

## FastAPI Endpoints (bot/api/routes.py)
```
GET  /api/status         — { engine_running, license_valid, mt5_connected, supabase_connected, pending_count, open_count, trailing_count }
GET  /api/config         — current config.json as JSON
PUT  /api/config         — update config fields (Pydantic validates, writes to file, hot-reloads)
POST /api/engine/start   — start the trading engine
POST /api/engine/stop    — stop the trading engine (keeps managing open positions until closed)
GET  /api/logs           — SSE stream: { event: "log", data: { level, timestamp, message } }
GET  /api/status/stream  — SSE stream: { event: "status", data: { ...status fields } }
```

Static files: FastAPI serves `frontend/dist/` at `/`. In dev, Vite dev server on `:5173` proxies `/api/*` to FastAPI on `:8501`.

## React Components (frontend/src/components/)
- **LicensePanel**: text input for license key, "Validate" button, green/red status dot
- **ControlPanel**: Start/Stop toggle button, lot mode radio (Risk % / Fixed) with contextual number inputs, MT5 + Supabase connection indicator dots
- **LogPanel**: auto-scrolling div, log entries color-coded by severity (INFO=gray, WARNING=yellow, ERROR=red), receives from SSE /api/logs
- **StatusBar**: numeric counts — active signals, pending orders, open positions, trailing positions

## Implementation Clarifications (decided during build, treat as final)

- **OrderStatus.CLOSED**: Added to the enum in `constants.py`. SQLite schema `status` column
  supports it. Reconciler uses it for "filled + gone from MT5" positions.

- **cancel_pending_order** added to `MT5Client` — uses `TRADE_ACTION_REMOVE`. Single attempt,
  no retry (cancellation is idempotent from the broker's perspective).

- **Partial close detection**: `FillDetector.detect_partial_close_tickets()` uses comment matching
  (`position.comment == "s{signal_id}"`) against positions not yet in SQLite. Does NOT parse
  `history_deals_get()`. This is simpler and reliable for ICMarkets hedging mode.

- **Pip size**: `symbol_info.point * 10` for instruments with `digits in (3, 5)` (FX and JPY);
  `symbol_info.point` for all others (metals, indices, crypto). Used in lot_calculator.py and
  will be needed for pip-unit TP threshold comparisons in the TP engine.

- **LotCalculator.calculate()** signature: `(stop_loss: float, limit_prices: list[float], mt5_symbol: str)`
  — takes primitives, not asyncpg.Record. Caller extracts fields before calling.

- **SQLiteDB**: holds a single persistent connection opened by `init_schema()`. Must be called
  once at startup before any other SQLiteDB method.

- **OffsetCalculator.check_drift()** threshold parameter is in absolute price units, not pips.
  Caller resolves it per asset class via `offset_drift_threshold(asset_class, config.offset_drift,
  db_sym)` — offset instruments are all non-forex, so the threshold is a dollar/point distance.

- **MarketScheduler** is defined in `bot/utils/time_utils.py`. `bot/core/scheduler.py` (step 28)
  imports it directly — no logic is duplicated there.

- **ICMarkets hedging: position ticket ≠ order ticket.** When an order fills, `position.identifier`
  == order ticket, but `position.ticket` is a NEW ID. SQLite stores the order ticket at placement.
  After fill detection, `sqlite.update_ticket(order_ticket, position_ticket)` rewrites the row so
  all downstream lookups (`{p.ticket: p for p in positions}`) work correctly.

- **Partial close remainder insert.** When `FillDetector.detect_partial_close_tickets()` returns a
  `NewTicketEvent`, sync_cycle inserts a new SQLite row with `limit_id = -new_ticket` (synthetic
  negative, guaranteed unique and never mistaken for a Supabase limit ID), `order_type = "remainder"`,
  then immediately calls `mark_filled()` and `set_trailing()`.

- **TP trigger uses price movement, not account P&L.** `profit_threshold` is compared to:
  - pips mode: `(bid - price_open) / pip_size` for longs, `(price_open - ask) / pip_size` for shorts
  - dollars mode: `bid - price_open` for longs, `price_open - ask` for shorts
  The "others combined P&L >= 0" guard uses `position.profit` (account currency).

- **db_symbol_from_mt5()** in `bot/trading/symbol_mapper.py` reverse-maps MT5 symbols to DB symbols
  (e.g., "BTCUSD" → "BTCUSDT", "AMD.NAS-24" → "AMD.NAS"). Required by TPEngine so it can call
  `detect_asset_class()` with the correct DB symbol.

- **symbol_suffixes** is a list of `{suffix, asset_classes}` rules. `map_symbol()` appends a rule's
  `suffix` to every resolved MT5 symbol (after symbol_map / stock_suffix resolution) whose detected
  asset class is listed in that rule — e.g. Exness "m" on forex/metals/crypto: EURUSD → EURUSDm,
  while indices/stocks stay bare. An asset class may appear in at most one rule (validated on load).
  `db_symbol_from_mt5()` reverses this by trying each suffix (longest first) and keeping the candidate
  that round-trips through `map_symbol()`. A legacy flat `universal_suffix` is migrated on load to one
  rule covering every asset class. Defaults to `[]` (no suffix).

- **close_position() and modify_position_sl()** added to `MT5Client`. close_position() uses
  `TRADE_ACTION_DEAL` with retry on transient errors. modify_position_sl() uses `TRADE_ACTION_SLTP`,
  single attempt (trailing retries naturally next cycle).

- **Adaptive polling.** Both sync_loop and tp_loop sleep `tp_active_interval_seconds` (1s) when
  `sqlite.get_all_active()` is non-empty; sleep `supabase_interval_seconds` (30s) when idle.

- **SyncCycle.run(placement_active=bool).** When False (engine stopped or license invalid), skips
  order placement and cancellation but still detects fills and partial close tickets.

- **Offset drift cancel-and-re-place.** Drifted pending orders are cancelled (status='cancelled').
  Since cancelled rows are excluded from `get_all_active()`, the limit reappears in `new_limit_ids`
  on the next cycle and is placed with the current offset.

- **SSEBroadcaster.last_msg** caches the most recent status broadcast. GET /api/status reads this
  cache — no MT5 call is made from the FastAPI handler (MT5 is engine-thread only).

- **Engine.app set externally.** main.py: `engine = Engine(...)`, `engine.app = create_app(engine)`,
  then starts the engine thread. `run_forever()` starts uvicorn only if `engine.app is not None`.

- **LicenseValidator dev bypass.** If `url` is empty string, `validate()` returns VALID immediately.
  Contributors without a live Edge Function can run the bot without license errors.

## DSN / Contributor Access

### DSN Loading (bot/config/settings.py)
1. Check for `.env` file -> load `SUPABASE_DSN` and `LICENSE_API_URL`
2. If no `.env` -> fall back to `_PRODUCTION_DSN` and `_PRODUCTION_LICENSE_URL` in `bot/config/constants.py`
3. Both constants are `""` (empty) in the repo. Owner fills them before compiling production binary.

### Owner's Production Build Workflow (document in CONTRIBUTING.md)
1. Edit `bot/config/constants.py`: set `_PRODUCTION_DSN` and `_PRODUCTION_LICENSE_URL` to real values
2. `cd frontend && npm run build` (produces `frontend/dist/`)
3. `pyinstaller bot.spec` (produces `.exe` with bundled dist/)
4. **Revert** `constants.py` to empty placeholders before pushing to git

### Contributor Role Setup (document in CONTRIBUTING.md with exact SQL)
1. Create read-only Postgres role in Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE contributor_bot WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'initial_password';
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO contributor_bot;
   GRANT SELECT ON signals, limits, live_prices, licenses TO contributor_bot;
   GRANT INSERT ON tp_outcomes TO contributor_bot;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON users TO contributor_bot;
   ```
2. Monthly password rotation:
   ```sql
   ALTER ROLE contributor_bot WITH PASSWORD 'new_password_here';
   ```
3. Share new `.env` with contributors containing updated DSN

### .env Format
```
SUPABASE_DSN=postgresql://contributor_bot:PASSWORD@db.xxxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
LICENSE_API_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co/functions/v1/validate-license
```
