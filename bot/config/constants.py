# Entries an instant-entry signal is sized against. The TM opens one at the market and
# the sender may average a second in later ("add"), at a price and a time nobody can
# know in advance — so risk is budgeted for both up front, treating the second as if it
# came at the first's price. Sizing against the one visible entry instead would double
# the signal's risk the moment the second arrived, since the added entry reuses its
# filled sibling's lot. A signal that never gets its second entry simply runs at half
# budget, which is the safe side of the guess.
