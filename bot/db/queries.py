# Supabase (PostgreSQL) — asyncpg, positional params $1 $2 ...

# One round-trip covering the three active-signal sets the sync cycle needs, folded
# to cut pooler egress. The caller splits the result by (signal_status, limit_status):
#   - active+pending limits to place (s.status in active/hit AND l.status='pending')
#   - 'hit' limits to spare from stale-cancel: the TM's feed reached the level but our
#     broker hasn't filled yet (sub-pip mismatch); a final signal status drops the
#     signal out, so genuine cancels/closes still cancel.
#   - every limit of a 'profit'-marked signal (no limit-status filter — marking 'profit'
#     flips still-pending limits to 'cancelled'): mapped {limit_id: signal_id} so the
#     caller can spare the ones it still holds while a filled position remains. Scoped to
#     $1 (the caller's currently-filled signal ids) — the caller discards every profit row
#     whose signal it isn't holding, so pulling the unbounded historical set (which grows
#     forever and blew pooler egress) is pure waste. Empty array => no profit rows.
